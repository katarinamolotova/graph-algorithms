# graph_algorithms

Teaching team project. Implemented in a team of two people. 
Team: [teammate: Mikhail Kukhtachev](https://github.com/Kuhtaaa)

In this project it was necessary to develop graph and graph algorithms libraries. It was also necessary to write a solution to the traveling salesman problem using the ant method and two more to choose from. We chose the branch and bound method and brute force. The whole project is covered by Google tests. When writing, we adhered to Google style.

The project uses a matrix template library also written by us.

The program contains a console interface
